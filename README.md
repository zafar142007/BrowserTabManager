# Tab Busy Bee
Utilities for managing the ever increasing tabs of my browser.
To install the chrome extension, follow https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked

Features supported:
1. By entering the domain name, the extension will be able to kill all tabs of that domain from all Chrome windows.
2. See the number of tabs grouped by their domain in decreasing order of count in all Chrome windows.
3. Search a tab using the tab title (case sensitive), and select it to navigate to it. If the selected tab is not in the current in focus window, the other window will not be focussed, but the tab in it will be changed to the newly selected one.
